# TDUEHeightmapGenerator
 Unreal Engine Heightmap Generator tool for Teardown.
 
Creating a heightmap in Photoshop is not very intiutive or user friendly. 

Why not use a better editor. 

With this tool you can use the landscaping features of Unreal Editor to make a perfect level and export it as a height map.
It is set up for the game "Teardown", but you can do with it whatever you want. 

It's just a project, not a packaged application - you need Unreal Engine 4.27 to use it.
